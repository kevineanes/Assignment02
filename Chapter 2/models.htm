   		<h1>Page content</h1>
   		<p>In HTML4 there were only two main content models, block and inline level elements. <b>Block level</b> elements would stack on top of each other in normal document flow while <b>inline level</b> elements typically appear within the flow of text content.</p>
   		<p>In this example the <b>heading 1<b> and the <b>paragraphs</b> are block level items, while the bold tags and the link below are examples of inline level elements.</p>
   		<p>In HTML5 new content models have been created to expand the structure and semantic capabilities of HTML. There are seven main models: <b> Flow, Metadata, Embedded, Interactive, Heading, Phrasing, and Sectioning</b>. To learn more about them, visit the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-html5-20110525/content-models.html#kinds-of-content" title="W3C HTML5 specification">interactive graphic</a> contained in the W3C HTML5 specification.</p>
